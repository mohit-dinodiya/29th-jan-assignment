    "# Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that supports several programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It also supports dynamic typing and automatic memory management, which make it easy to use and learn. Additionally, Python has a large standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, from web development to scientific computing, and it also has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that extend its capabilities even further."

    "\n",
    "Python code is interpreted, meaning that it is executed directly by the Python interpreter without being compiled into machine code beforehand. When you run a Python program, the interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, translating each statement into machine code on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does use a form of compilation in the background. When you import a module or package, Python compiles the source code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that can be executed more efficiently by the interpreter. The bytecode is stored in .pyc files and is used to speed up the loading of the module on subsequent imports.\n",

    "# How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a process called garbage collection. Python uses a built-in mechanism called the reference counting method to keep track of the objects in memory. Each object in memory has a reference count that keeps track of how many times the object is referred to in the code. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means that there are no more references to that object, and it is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's garbage collector periodically checks the reference counts of all objects in memory and removes objects that have a reference count of zero. The garbage collector is responsible for freeing up memory that is no longer being used, and it does this automatically without the need for explicit memory management by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the reference counting mechanism, Python also has a system of memory allocation and deallocation that helps to manage memory more efficiently. When a new object is created in Python, memory is allocated for that object. When the object is no longer needed, the memory is deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management system is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing developers to focus on writing code without having to worry about memory allocation and deallocation."
